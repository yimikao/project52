# Project52 Go Challenge

A project to write a small project everyweek. All projects are written in Golang. I also plan on adding tests to up my testing game.


## Preface:

I saw Evan Lin's [project52](https://github.com/yimikao/project52) and felt inspired. So, I hope I could learn something by doing the same challenge myself.

## Constraints:

Here are the constraints of Project52.

- The project could be small or big, but it should be something new not just refactoring an old project.

- Don't need to create a brand new project, could rewrite some existing project. (but my own way, not allowed to fork and refine.)

## Progress (2022/01/01~2022/07/01)

1. (01/01) [a fintech backend api](https://github.com/yimikao/go-fintech-app) 
1. (01/18~01/21) [a cli to manage expenses for different users](https://github.com/yimikao/accountant) 
2. (01/26~01/31) [a reddit clone](https://github.com/yimikao/reddit-clone)


## Provide Idea or Encourage...

Please file an `issue` if you want to suggest a small project idea. (hopefully it could be done within one week.  :p ).

You can also encourage me by `starring` this project.
